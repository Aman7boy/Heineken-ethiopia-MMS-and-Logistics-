<h2> 1 Introduction</h2>
<h3> 1.0.1 Background of the study</h3>
<main>
    logistics and Supply chain has emerged as bedrock in creating a competitive advantage for businesses. The 
management of supply chain explores into strategies aimed at optimizing the firm's overall worth 
through efficient usage and allotment of assets throughout the organization. A supply chain 
contains a series of value-increasing tasks that establish connections between a company's 
suppliers and its clients. This system encompasses producers, suppliers, carriers, warehouses, 
retailers, and end consumers. Internally, within an entity like a manufacturer, the supply chain 
comprises of all operational facets involved in customer demand fulfillment. These facets 
include activities like product innovation, marketing, production, logistics, finance, customer 
support, and other interrelated operations focused on meeting customer needs (Chopra and 
Meindl, 2007).
Successful execution of supply chain management plays a vital role in establishing and 
upholding a competitive edge in the provision of both products and services by organizations. 
According to Gunasekaran and Ngai (2004), as well as Sufian (2010), the efficiency of a supply 
chain is impacted by the proficient management and smooth integration of essential information
within the supply chain network.
A supply chain strategy is depicted in relation to that of its competitors, incorporating the array 
of customer needs it seeks to fulfill through its arrangement of products and services (Chopra 
and Meindl, 2007: 22). Strategic decisions include major decisions such as supplier selection, 
positioning of facilities, and distribution channel determination. These decisions are guided by 
the objective of expediting the marketing goals of an organization. A typical supply chain 
strategy should aim to achieve an ordered flow at an optimal cost. It is now widely accepted that 
a universal view is not suitable when formulating a supply chain strategy to serve a broad range
of products with various attributes sold in differing markets (Christopher, Peck and Towill, 2006: 
277). Supply chain strategies need to be tailored to align with the 'order winning criteria' of the
particular market. Ensuring the firm's operations are in alignment with market demand has not 
always been extended to the wider supply chain. An organization's sourcing strategy, operations 
strategy, and route-to-market strategy must be fitting for the specific product or market 
conditions (Christopher, 2005:117). The significant moves in the global competition
environment and concepts like outsourcing require organizations to craft supply chain strategies 
that are in line with fitting value propositions and customer market sections. The primary 
common strategies in supply chain management are lean and agile. Leanness entails building a 
value stream to removing all forms of waste, and establishing a consistent schedule, while 
Agility entails using market knowledge to maximize on profitable opportunities in a dynamic 
market (Mason-Jones, Naylor, and Towill, 2000:4064).

<h3>
 1.2   Background of The Study
</h3>
<main>
Founded in 1864 in Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, Heineken’s establishment is celebrated for its commitment to quality, tradition, and upheaval within the beer industry. Having anestablished history of more than a hundred years, Heineken has come up as an international figure,attracting the attention of beer enthusiasts worldwide. The identifiable green bottle,decorated with a red star, is easily recognized on shelves and in bars all over the world.The commitment of the brand to greatness goes beyond its products; it personifies a way of life,a tribute to togetherness,and a tribute to various junctures in life,whether grand or modest. (Tom Coggins, 2018).The success of Heineken is not entirely derived from its typical brew but also from its ability to grow and launch new elements. The brand regularly explores into fresh flavors, brewing and packaging methods. Furthermore,there is a strong focus on sustainability within the company.Initiatives such as the water usage reduction, local sourcing and procurement, and the promotion of responsible drinking underscore Heineken's enthusiasm to environmental and societal ideals.The Ethiopian alcoholic beverage manufacturing industry is experiencing a significant rise in foreign investments, with international institutions setting forth an increased interest in the sector, and the foremost foreign beverage production companies expanding their impression in the quickly growing Ethiopian economy (Ethiopian Food, Beverage, and Pharmaceuticals Industry Development Institute, 2016).

As new participants enter the market and jointly work with local producers to improve the quality of products, the beer industry has undergone several transformations over the past decade. Heineken, BGI Ethiopia, Habesha, and Anbesa are among the major manufacturers working in Ethiopia.Around twelve breweries exist in Ethiopia, under the possession of six 
companies,these breweries produce diverse beer varieties and by-products, and distribute them through different supply chain channels and strategies. The total annual production capacity is an estimated 12 million hectoliters,although there is no accessible data on the real production figures.Heineken remains dutifully firm in nurturing responsible marketing and consumption practices.It adds value by engaging customers with a diverse range of products such as <mark>Heineken®,Bedele Regular, Bedele Special,Harar,Walia,Sofi Malt, Bertat, and Buckler</mark>. Heineken has established an outstanding presence in Ethiopia through its brewery situated around Kilinto, at the outskirts of the capital, Addis Ababa. This state of the art brewery boasts a total capacity of 5.6 million hectoliters and it currently produces beer brands like Walia®, Bedele®, Harar®, and the flagship Heineken® beer.Through an enterprise for local barley sourcing, Heineken assists small-holder farmers, ensuring that its contribution extends beyond the brewery. Communication advertising responsible consumption, access to clean water, and safety in the area of its breweries are indispensible to Heineken's commitments.

<h3>
   1.3 problem of The Statment
</h3>
<p>
    Even though logistics is a decisive factor to channel what the company owns to the rest, 
companies gave little attention to in and out material movements which ensures the company 
output to market (Cui and Hertz, 2011).Very recently logistics performance is considered as a 
critical factor to determine business performance and manufacturing industries are forced to give 
due attention for logistics activities to access new revenue generation markets and maintain 
already existed markets because business becomes more of customer oriented due to the 
availability of many service providers and as more and more firms compete to survive with 
introduction of products with short life cycle. 
As a matter of fact, in-effective logistics causes competitive loss in the journey to market 
(Odhiambo et al, 2017). Major activities in the firm are dependent on logistics performance 
which is mainly expressed under logistics activities. Under those activities logistics links 
company with external customers and make sure acquisition costs are minimized to available 
inventories that can meet customer requirement which are stored in a place where products are 
safe and ready to use. Taking the customers interest in to consideration the company would also 
transport its product to the right place.<br>
As per the research made by Fekadu Debela (2013), beer industries in Ethiopia are performing 
in a country where logistics system is characterized by poor logistics management system, lack 
of coordination of goods transport, low level of development of logistics infrastructure, 
inadequate fleets of freight vehicles in number and age, damage and quality deterioration of 
goods while handling, transporting and in storage. Besides African countries where Ethiopia is 
not an exception are suffering largely due to the non-application of the principles of supply chain 
management practices such as logistics to business activities (Mensah et al, 2014). Heineken 
Ethiopia is not an exception for all the facts said because the company points out lost sales, 
customer dissatisfaction, interrupted production, low perfect customer order, high working 
capital, low asset utilization, low operational performance indicator, high overtime costs, excess 
costs due to rush orders and stock transfer, scrapped goods and aged products as associated 
liabilities due mainly by logistics practices (Heineken Ethiopia Logistics Process Standard, 2012; 
Business Comparison System, 2016) 
In general, activities of logistics are remarkably expensive, if not controlled effectively, it is the
second costly activity in organizations next to cost of goods sold (International Monetary Fund,

<main>
This study would provide organized and practical frameworks for company managements on 
measuring and explaining logistics activities under dimensions of customer response, inventory 
planning and management, supply, transportation, and warehousing and finally those activity 
effects on the level sales volume. It enables to specifically indicate which dimension they are 
good and worst; so that they will decide which element needs due attention and which dimension 
practice is good to continue with taking in to consideration the level sales volume. 
The study would also provide an awareness for beer industries operating in Ethiopia weather 
logistics activities and practices has effect on sales volume and what could be done to take the 
best out of this discipline. More importantly this study could break the status quo of opinions 
which assumes logistics is far to affect sales volume. 
Moreover, this study has academic contribution since it will be in use as a stepping stone for 
further studies in areas of logistics and its impact on sales volume taking in to consideration the 
hardly found researches on the area of the study.

<h2></mark>1.12 Research Methodology</h2>
<h5>Research Design</h5>
<main>Descriptive research design was used to acquire information regarding the present status of the 
phenomena and to describe what exists with regards to variables in a scenario. Therefore, in 
order to assess the effect of logistics activities on level of sales volume at Heineken breweries 
S.C, Ethiopia descriptive research design was applied; because the researcher collected 
information on the sales volume of the company in relation to the factors that influence i.e. 
logistic activities, with an aim to describe, examine and determine the effect of logistic activities 
on level of sales volume at Heineken breweries S.C, Ethiopia. Moreover, it also used explanatory 
type whereby the effect of logistics activities on the level sales volume in the case of Heineken 
Breweries S.C will be assessed and explained. Such design will help to observe the influence of 
independent variables on the dependent variable to clearly view the cause and effect link between 
those study variables. 
 </main>
 <h5>research Approach</h5>
 <main> order to achieve the objectives of this study and thereby to give answer for the basic research hypothesis, quantitative research approach had been used by the researcher. There are compelling reasons why the researcher stick to use quantitative method. For instance, the adoption of positivist paradigm entails that measurement remains an essential element since its basic assumption in social and economic phenomenon can be measured. So, this helps to deeper insights on the issue, to significantly strengthen the analyses and thus enhance confidence in the conclusions. 
<li> Population of the Study 
The population of the study was Heineken Breweries S.C, Ethiopia in revealing the effect of 
logistics activities such as customer response, supply, transportation, warehousing and inventory planning and management on level of sales volume.</li>
<li>Sampling Technique From the five registered beer factories, this study purposively selected Heineken Breweries S.C, Ethiopia under the below criteria’s in mind:-</li>
<li> Logistics Activities Implementation: beer companies’ logistics department lacks a propercategorization under the five dimensions; which means almost all companies are practicing logistics activities for their day to day operations not in formal categorization but in the traditional way of considering logistics in terms of transportation and warehousing (Ayenew, 
2016).</li>
<li> Production capacity: it is obvious to say as production capacity increases related activitydensity will also increases. Africa produces 145 mhl and Ethiopia who is the fourth largest beer producer country in Africa after South Africa, Nigeria, and Angola contributes 9.95mhl. Fromthis volume currently Heineken Breweries S.C has production capacity of 4mhl which is almost half of the country contribution to the total Africans portion. Accordingly the finding was 
generalized to the whole beer factories. 
<li> Sales Volume - is the number of units sold within a reporting period, the company is the 
second larger market share owner in the beer industry.</li>
<li> Portfolio Brands - Heineken with its plenty of SKUs (Walia, Bedele, Harar, Buckler, Sofi, Heineken, Hakim Stout, and Sergegen) was considered.In fact as the researcher points of view and depth investigation, the logistic activity of this company varied with the other. In addition this company produces more than eleven portfolio brands. So, taking all the above consideration into account, the researcher took Heineken Breweries S.C purposively. </li>
 </main>
<h2>1.13 Descriptive Analaysis</h2>
<main>
 Heineken Ethiopia has developed a comprehensive logistics and supply chain system to support its brewing operations across the country. This system encompasses the procurement of raw materials, production processes, and distribution networks to ensure efficient delivery of products to consumers.

Local Sourcing and Supplier Development

A key component of Heineken Ethiopia's supply chain strategy is the local sourcing of raw materials, particularly malt barley. In collaboration with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), Heineken implemented a project aimed at strengthening local malt barley supply chains. This initiative focused on increasing productivity, enhancing the business skills of aggregators, facilitating access to finance, and improving the price competitiveness of Ethiopian malt barley. As a result, Heineken significantly increased its local sourcing from 5,000 metric tons in 2017/18 to 19,000 metric tons in 2018/19. 

E-Supply Chain Management

Heineken Ethiopia has also embraced electronic supply chain management (e-SCM) systems to enhance operational efficiency. A study examining the effect of e-SCM on customer satisfaction at Heineken's Addis Ababa branch found that the perceived performance of e-SCM positively influences end-user satisfaction. This suggests that the adoption of digital tools in supply chain operations contributes to improved service delivery and customer experience. 

Logistics Activities and Sales Performance

Efficient logistics activities are crucial for Heineken Ethiopia's sales performance. Research assessing the effects of logistics on sales volume identified five interdependent activities: customer service, inventory management, order processing, transportation, and warehousing. The study concluded that effective management of these logistics activities positively impacts sales volume, highlighting the importance of an integrated logistics approach in achieving business objectives. 

Sustainability and Localization

Heineken Ethiopia is committed to sustainable practices within its supply chain. By developing a domestic and regional supplier base, the company reduces reliance on imports, minimizes the need for foreign currency, and supports local economic development. This localization strategy not only enhances supply chain resilience but also aligns with broader sustainability goals. 

In summary, Heineken Ethiopia's modern logistics and supply chain system integrates local sourcing initiatives, digital management tools, efficient logistics activities, and sustainability efforts. These elements collectively contribute to the company's operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and alignment with local economic development objectives.
